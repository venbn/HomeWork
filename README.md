## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)

My recommendation to Coinbase would be to consider expanding itself as a local brand across the other countries in the World. Example: there is Coinbase Australian exchange and there is no local Coinbase crypto debit card which can be tied-up with Australian currency, it would be great if there was one.

If Coinbase has its exchanges collaborate with the local Banks – that would help customers trade, exchange FIAT and crypto currencies for each other for different purposes. Day-to-day spending using crypto can be made easy by a Crypto debit or even credit card. Example: AMEX is almost available in every country.

Example: I should be able to buy a coffee using crypto debit card using any crypto currency I own, and i think exchanges like Coinbase can make a big difference.

Coinbase will need to integrate with the country’s local cloud provider for efficient and scalable computing power so that data operations are much faster and also secure. The Decentralized Financial (DeFi) applications and Decentralized (Dapps) applications must be able to fully integrate with the country’s local network and must be fully operational adhering to country local government and security policies.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Coinbase will be the only crypto exchange in the world who would be able to get crypto into every individual’s day-to-day life by launching a local crypto debit card which is integrated with the local banks and the local FIAT currency which can make Coinbase a global leader in making crypto mainstream.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

The core technologies would be blockchain applications facilitating financial transactions by integrating with the local banks and leverage technologies like Corda, Web3 applications supporting decentralized financial operations, cloud platform to facilitate distributed computing power for scalable performance.

Private and public Blockchain architecture will help perform decentralized financial transactions like integrating Coinbase with the local banks. Use of Corda would help perform secure private blockchain transactions with the banks.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

These technologies are important because it is important to ensure cryptocurrency transactions are faster, safe and efficient enough to gain public trust.
